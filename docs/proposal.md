### Research Topic  
**Detection of Malware Using Quantum Convolutional Neural Network**

## Abstract

Modern cybersecurity faces unprecedented challenges from sophisticated malware attacks targeting critical infrastructure systems, necessitating revolutionary detection methodologies that transcend the limitations of classical approaches. Traditional signature-based detection methods prove inadequate against zero-day threats, while classical machine learning approaches struggle with computational complexity and real-time adaptability to evolving attack patterns. 

This research proposes an advanced malware detection framework leveraging Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) through a novel multi-encoding distributed architecture. The design addresses current quantum hardware constraints while maximizing quantum computational advantages.

The methodology employs a comprehensive six-stage pipeline integrating quantum data encoding strategies (including hybrid angle encoding) with section-specific PE (Portable Executable) binary analysis using distributed 8-qubit QCNNs. Each malware binary is decomposed into critical PE sections (`.text`, `.data`, `.rdata`, `.rsrc`, `.reloc`), converted to 8×8 grayscale images, and processed through specialized quantum circuits for enhanced feature extraction. The distributed quantum processing outputs are integrated through classical ensemble methods (like XGBoost, Random Forest) for final classification. 

Experimental validation will be conducted on datasets such as BODMAS and PEMachineLearning, alongside other specialized datasets, to ensure robust evaluation. Expected contributions include new benchmarking standards for quantum cybersecurity, scalable quantum-classical hybrid strategies, and open-source frameworks for quantum-enhanced malware detection. This research provides both theoretical advancements in distributed quantum processing and practical solutions for real-world malware detection in increasingly connected digital infrastructures.
