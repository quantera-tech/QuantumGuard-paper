# Modern Cybersecurity: A Quantum Convolutional Neural Network Approach to Malware Detection

## Abstract

Modern cybersecurity faces unprecedented challenges from sophisticated malware attacks targeting critical infrastructure systems, necessitating revolutionary detection methodologies that transcend the limitations of classical approaches. Traditional signature-based detection methods prove inadequate against zero-day threats, while classical machine learning approaches struggle with computational complexity and real-time adaptability to evolving attack patterns. This research proposes an advanced malware detection framework leveraging Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) through a novel multi-encoding distributed architecture specifically designed to address current quantum hardware constraints while maximizing quantum computational advantages. The methodology employs a comprehensive six-stage pipeline integrating quantum data encoding strategies including hybrid angle encoding with section-specific Portable Executable (PE) binary analysis using distributed 8-qubit QCNNs. Each malware binary is systematically decomposed into critical PE sections (.text, .data, .rdata, .rsrc, .reloc), converted to 8×8 grayscale images, and processed through specialized quantum circuits employing parameterized gates with entanglement patterns for enhanced feature extraction. The distributed quantum processing outputs are then integrated through classical ensemble methods including XGBoost and Random Forest for final classification, with this hybrid classical-quantum integration serving as an optional enhancement to the core quantum framework. Experimental validation will be conducted on comprehensive malware datasets including BODMAS and PEMachineLearning repositories, along with additional specialized datasets, to ensure robust evaluation across diverse attack vectors. The proposed framework aims to significantly outperform classical approaches while maintaining practical deployment feasibility on NISQ-era quantum devices. Expected contributions include establishing systematic benchmarking standards for quantum cybersecurity applications, developing scalable quantum-classical hybrid integration strategies, and creating open-source frameworks for quantum-enhanced malware detection. This research addresses critical gaps in current quantum machine learning applications for cybersecurity, providing both theoretical advances in distributed quantum processing and practical solutions for real-world malware detection challenges in an increasingly connected digital infrastructure.

# Literature Review

## Dataset

### BODMAS Dataset
The BODMAS (Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware Analysis) dataset represents a significant advancement in malware research infrastructure, addressing critical gaps in existing PE malware datasets that have limited researchers' ability to conduct comprehensive temporal analysis and concept drift studies. Developed through collaboration between Blue Hexagon and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and introduced by Yang et al. in 2021, the dataset was specifically designed to overcome two major limitations in existing malware datasets: the lack of recent timestamped malware samples and the absence of well-curated family information. The dataset contains a comprehensive collection of 134,435 samples, comprising 57,293 malware samples and 77,142 benign samples, collected over a 13-month period from August 2019 to September 2020, making it one of the most temporally comprehensive malware datasets available for research purposes. Unlike earlier datasets such as the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge or EMBER, which primarily focused on static snapshots of malware samples, BODMAS incorporates precise timestamp information based on VirusTotal reports, enabling researchers to analyze the temporal evolution of malware families and study concept drift phenomena where malware patterns evolve over time as attackers adapt their strategies to evade detection systems. 

The dataset's malware samples are categorized into 581 carefully curated families, representing a significant improvement over previous datasets that either lacked family information or provided poorly classified samples. The malware distribution includes major categories such as Trojan (29,972 samples, 52.3%), Worm (16,697 samples, 29.1%), Backdoor (7,331 samples, 12.8%), Downloader (1,031 samples, 1.8%), and Ransomware (821 samples, 1.4%), providing comprehensive coverage of the contemporary malware landscape. Each sample in the BODMAS dataset is represented as a 2,381-dimensional feature vector extracted using the LIEF (Library to Instrument Executable Formats) project version 0.9.0, following the same methodology as the EMBER dataset. The feature extraction process encompasses comprehensive static analysis of PE file characteristics, with features organized into seven distinct data types: continuous features, categorical features, hash categorical features, discrete features with large ranges, binary features, hash categorical discrete features, and memory-related features. The dataset is distributed in multiple formats, including feature vectors and metadata that are publicly available (bodmas.npz approximately 250 MB and bodmas_metadata.csv approximately 12 MB), while the original malware binaries are available upon request for research purposes.


### EMBER Dataset

The EMBER (Endgame Malware BEnchmark for Research) dataset represents a cornerstone contribution to the malware detection research community, addressing a critical void in publicly available, large-scale benchmark datasets for training machine learning models to detect malicious Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Developed by Anderson and Roth at Endgame Inc. and introduced in 2018, the dataset was specifically designed to overcome significant challenges that had previously hindered collaborative research in machine learning-based malware detection, including legal restrictions on sharing binaries, labeling complexities, and security liability concerns. The dataset comprises features extracted from 1.1 million binary files, with 900,000 training samples (300,000 malicious, 300,000 benign, and 300,000 unlabeled) and 200,000 test samples (100,000 malicious and 100,000 benign), making it substantially larger than previous datasets such as the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge which contained only 20,000 samples.

The EMBER dataset's distinctive architecture centers on its comprehensive feature extraction methodology that transforms raw PE files into structured, machine-learning-ready representations through the Library to Instrument Executable Formats (LIEF) project. Each sample in the dataset is represented as a 2,351-dimensional feature vector derived from eight distinct groups of raw features that capture both parsed PE file characteristics and format-agnostic statistical properties. The eight feature groups include general file information (containing file size, virtual size, number of imports/ sections, thread local storage, resources, relocations, signatures, and symbols), header information (encompassing COFF header data such as timestamps, target machine specifications, and image characteristics, alongside optional header details including subsystem information, DLL characteristics, version data, and size metrics), imported functions (parsed from the import address table and vectorized using feature hashing with 256 bins for libraries and 1,024 bins for individual functions), exported functions (summarized using 128-bin feature hashing), and section information (including section names, sizes, entropy values, virtual sizes, and characteristics, with 50 bins allocated for each metric).  

The dataset's temporal structure and labeling methodology reflect careful consideration of real-world malware evolution patterns, with samples temporally split between training and test sets to mimic generational dependencies of both malicious and benign software. Each sample includes SHA-256 hash identifiers, coarse temporal information with month-level resolution, and labels indicating benign (0), malicious (1), or unlabeled (-1) status. The labeling process employed rigorous validation through VirusTotal, ensuring that benign samples showed no vendor detections and malicious samples were flagged by more than 40 vendors, establishing EMBER as what the authors characterize as a relatively "easy" dataset for establishing baseline performance metrics. The inclusion of 300,000 unlabeled samples in the training set was specifically designed to encourage research in semi-supervised learning approaches, representing a relatively unexplored area in malware classification literature at the time of the dataset's release.

Quertier _et al._ (2023) address the challenges of limited qubit availability and information loss in quantum-based malware detection. The authors note that traditional QCNNs, constrained to eight or fewer qubits, have historically underperformed compared to classical models, particularly when tasked with analyzing high-dimensional malware binary images. To overcome this, the researchers introduce a **distributed QCNN** framework that decomposes each malware binary into five critical Portable Executable (PE) sections (.text, .data, .rdata, .rsrc, .reloc), converting each into an 8 × 8 grayscale image. Each section is then processed by a dedicated 8-qubit QCNN employing parameterized entangling gates for convolution and pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, with data encoded via angle embedding. The outputs—section scores or a value of -1 for missing sections—are then integrated through an XGBoost classifier for final malware or benign classification. The dataset is sourced from **BODMAS** and **PEMachineLearning** repositories, comprising tens of thousands of labeled PE files, and is split into subsets for QCNN training, scoring-function training, and final testing. Results show that while individual QCNNs on sections like _.rdata_ achieve moderate F1-scores (up to 0.78), the hybrid approach with XGBoost significantly outperforms both single-QCNN and classical baselines, reaching **83 % accuracy** and a **0.83 F1-score**—representing a _20 % improvement_ over monolithic QCNN models. The findings highlight the particular significance of the _.rdata_ and _.rsrc_ sections for malware detection, the utility of treating missing sections as informative features, and the synergy between quantum and classical methods for robust classification. The architecture is also scalable, allowing new sections to be added without retraining existing QCNNs. The authors recommend future research on incorporating additional PE sections, optimizing QCNN architectures for specific section types, and exploring weighted scoring strategies to further enhance detection performance.

Akash _et al._ (2022) highlighted the growing concern of malware threats targeting smart grid devices, particularly due to the increased connectivity and seamless firmware updates in modern power systems1. One notable study proposes a cloud-based, device-specific malware detection system that leverages a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) integrated with Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) to address the limitations of classical machine learning approaches in this domain. The primary challenge tackled by this research is the inadequacy of conventional CNNs to extract deep, discriminative features from malware image files, especially under the computational constraints of current quantum hardware, which limits the number of available qubits and thus the input image size. To overcome this, the authors design a QCNN architecture that encodes malware binaries—collected from both benign firmware and manipulated Conti ransomware—into grayscale images suitable for quantum processing, with further dimensionality reduction to fit within a seven-qubit limit. The QCNN employs quantum circuits, including RY gates for data encoding and controlled-rotation gates for convolution, inspired by classical Sobel filters, to enhance feature extraction. The DTL component utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50V2 model, retraining only the final layers on device-specific data to adapt to new smart grid devices without losing generalization. The system is deployed on the IBM Watson Studio cloud platform, utilizing IBM Quantum processors for the quantum computations. Experimental results demonstrate that the QCNN-based approach achieves higher detection accuracy and faster convergence compared to classical CNNs, validating the effectiveness of quantum feature extraction in malware discrimination. However, the study also acknowledges limitations such as the need for aggressive image downscaling due to qubit constraints, focus on a narrow range of malware types, and reliance on specific quantum hardware, with future work suggested to address broader malware scenarios, improve noise resilience, and expand device applicability


Yang et al. (2021) addressed the critical gap in malware research datasets by introducing BODMAS (Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware AnalysiS), which specifically tackles two fundamental limitations in existing PE malware datasets: the absence of recent timestamped malware samples and the lack of well-curated family information essential for temporal analysis and concept drift studies. Recognizing that previous datasets like Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge, EMBER, UCSB-Packed, and SOREL-20M either contained outdated samples (2017-2019), insufficient family labels, or lacked temporal metadata, the authors compiled a comprehensive dataset containing 57,293 malware samples and 77,142 benign samples collected from August 2019 to September 2020, meticulously labeled across 581 malware families by security analysts using both automated scripts and manual verification. The dataset structure provides SHA-256 hashes, original PE binaries (malware only), 2,381-dimensional feature vectors compatible with EMBER format, ground-truth binary labels, curated family information, and first-seen timestamps based on VirusTotal reports. Through extensive empirical analysis using Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Deep Neural Networks across different time periods, the study demonstrated significant concept drift effects where classifiers trained on older datasets showed degraded performance on newer data, with F1 scores dropping substantially over time, particularly revealing that unseen malware families contributed to false negative rates as high as 43.04% compared to 6% for known families. Key findings established that concept drift primarily stems from the emergence of new malware families rather than evolution within existing families, and that periodic retraining with minimal labeled data (1% monthly) or training classifiers on recent data significantly mitigates performance degradation. However, the study's limitations include the unavailability of benign binaries due to copyright restrictions, preliminary analysis scope focusing primarily on static features without addressing packed/obfuscated malware challenges, reliance on automated family labeling scripts that may introduce noise for novel variants, and the constrained temporal window (one year) which may not capture longer-term malware evolution patterns. Despite these constraints, BODMAS represents a foundational contribution to malware research infrastructure, enabling systematic evaluation of concept drift adaptation strategies and providing a robust benchmark for developing more resilient, temporally-aware malware detection systems.


Anderson and Roth (2018) introduced EMBER to address the longstanding absence of a large, openly shared benign–malicious Windows PE dataset suitable for training and evaluating static malware detection models. They extracted features from 1.1 million binaries—900 K for training (300 K benign, 300 K malicious, 300 K unlabeled) and 200 K for testing (100 K benign, 100 K malicious)—parsing PE headers, imports/exports, section metadata, and format-agnostic byte and string histograms, and packaging each sample as a JSON record with SHA-256, coarse timestamp, and label. Evaluating a baseline LightGBM gradient-boosted decision-tree on 2,351-dimensional feature vectors, they achieved ROC AUC > .999, 92.99% detection at 0.1% FPR, and 98.2% at 1% FPR, outperforming the featureless end-to-end MalConv deep network (AUC = .998, 92.2% at 0.1% FPR). Key findings demonstrate that hand-crafted static features still outpace raw-bytes deep learning for PE detection. Limitations include the lack of raw benign binaries (only hashes), which precludes certain dynamic or adversarial analyses, fixed pre-extracted features that constrain novel feature research, and the dataset’s focus on static analysis without unpacking or obfuscation handling. EMBER thus establishes a robust, extensible benchmark for advancing ML-based malware detection research.
