## Discover
Researched on EMBER dataset and its ways of conversion to image data. EMBER dataset cannot be directly used in QCNN architecture. As a result, we need to transform those dataset to image data. EMBER dataset is available on Kaggle. PEMachineLearning which is a subset of EMBER dataset is available on M. Lester’s site.

## Investigate
It was found that EMBER dataset contains 2,351 feature vectors which have to be converted to image data. Also, found multiple conversion techniques – PCA, t-SNE, Histogram chart etc.

## Ponder
We have to select an efficient and suitable conversion technique among the suggested ones to convert the 2,351 feature vectors of EMBER dataset.
